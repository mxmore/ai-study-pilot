# NestJS API Skeleton

This directory contains a lightweight NestJS scaffold outlining the service modules for the AI Study Pilot project.

## Modules
- `QuestionsModule` – question retrieval and adaptive serving
- `PlansModule` – spaced repetition schedules
- `DocumentsModule` – ingestion orchestration and AI document processing hooks
- `ReportsModule` – analytics and learning insights delivery

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Generate application boilerplate via Nest CLI: `nest new ai-study-pilot`
3. Copy service modules from the `src` folder in this repository (to be implemented).

> The NestJS implementation is optional for the MVP but the skeleton exists for teams preferring TypeScript on the backend.
